### Tutorial

Make sure you have spotify running externally, then in Vim:

    :Spotify yeezus

Yields a new window with the search results

    Track                                                 Artist                            Album
    Black Skinhead                                        Kanye West                        Yeezus
    Bound 2                                               Kanye West                        Yeezus
    Blood On The Leaves                                   Kanye West                        Yeezus
    New Slaves                                            Kanye West                        Yeezus
    Send It Up                                            Kanye West                        Yeezus
    Hold My Liquor                                        Kanye West                        Yeezus
    I Am A God                                            Kanye West                        Yeezus
    I'm In It                                             Kanye West                        Yeezus
    On Sight                                              Kanye West                        Yeezus
    Guilt Trip                                            Kanye West                        Yeezus

Just hit enter to have the song played by spotify. If you want, you can even hit enter on the artists (for a list of their albums) and albums (for a list of all the songs in that album).

### Region Configuration

To filter the results appropriate to your region add the line below to your
`.vimrc` with the correct country code.

    let g:spotify_country_code = 'GB'

#### PlayPause, Next, Prev Keys

For linux operating systems with dbus, you can map specific keys to
play/pause, next and previous.

    let g:spotify_prev_key = "<F9>"
    let g:spotify_playpause_key = "<F10>"
    let g:spotify_next_key = "<F11>"

These mappings will only work inside the spotify list buffer.

### Installation

#### Checking if your installation of vim is compatible

This plugin isn't compatible with installations of vim on versions below 7.4.

To check your version of vim run:

    vim --version

If your installation isn't compatible then you need to update your version

#### Installing the plugin

I recommend installing using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

Add `Bundle 'takac/vim-spotifysearch'` to your `~/.vimrc` and then:

* either within Vim: `:BundleInstall`
* or in your shell: `vim +BundleInstall +qall`

##### Other Installation Methods
*  [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
    *  `git clone https://github.com/takac/vim-spotifysearch ~/.vim/bundle/vim-spotifysearch`
*  [Neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
    *  `NeoBundle 'takac/vim-spotifysearch'`
*  Manual
    *  Copy the files into your `~/.vim` directory

#### Installing 'spotipy'

In order for this plugin to work, you will need to install ['spotipy'](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy).
